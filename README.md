# Employee_Salary_Analysis

I got six CSV files with the employee details from 1980 to 1990 and took up the task of analyzing and uncovering insights. As I want to get familiar with SQL and the process of loading data into databases, I choose to do it in PostgreSQL.

# Data Modelling
The data model has always been a buzzword for me, and this analysis helped me understand the benefits of data models. Data models are the models that are built to support the storing of the data into the database. I used  http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com to create the data model for the project. The entity-relationship diagrams with the relationship are built to help me make the tables in my database.

# Data Engineering
After understanding the data and its relationship, I created the tables and loaded the data from the CSV's to the respective tables.

# Data Analysis



# Getting Started

1. Open employee_SQL folder.
2. Please find the entity relationship diagrams inside the data_modelling folder
3. The schema.sql is inside the data_engineering folder. There is also a text file that has the schema.
